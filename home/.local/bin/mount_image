# mount_image, a program that mounts a specific partition from a RAW
# disk image file, such as a full-disk dd copy or a file used by QEMU.
# Note that compressed and other space-saving formats (qcaw2, etc.)
# will NOT work!

# Use:
# mount_image image_file partition_number mount_point
#
# For instance,
#
# mount_image image.raw 2 /mnt/shared
#
# mounts partition 2 from image.raw at /mnt/shared.

# This program relies on my GPT fdisk (gdisk) program to help identify
# partitions. I could have used regular fdisk, but this would have
# limited the program to working with MBR-formatted disks. With gdisk,
# both MBR- and GPT-formatted disks will work.
